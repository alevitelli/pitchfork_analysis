## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

The data is from Kaggle and can be found at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/nolanbconaway/pitchfork-data)

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in understanding whether, analysing Pitchfork reviews data from 1999 to 2016, we could see signs of any potential implicit bias in terms of preferred genres. 
The questions I asked myself during the analysis were:
1. Does Pitchfork prefer reviews of certain genres?
2. Are there any noticeable trends that change over the years?
3. Are certain genres consistently rated higher than others?
4. Is this true also for the percentage of albums rated as Best New Music?

## File Descriptions
This repo hosts the Jupyter notebook on which I prepared the data and did some exploratory analysis. 

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@alessandro.vitelli78/are-pitchfork-reviews-biased-be28c74e3de6)

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Pitchfork and Kaggle for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/nolanbconaway/pitchfork-data).
